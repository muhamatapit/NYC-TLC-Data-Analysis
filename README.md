# NYC-TLC-Data-Analysis
# Background
Taxis in New York City (NYC) are a key element in the city's transportation system, offering fast and flexible services amidst the hustle and complexity of public transport. Known as one of the world's largest metropolises, NYC is always bustling, and taxis play a crucial role in connecting various parts of the city, particularly those less accessible by subway and bus. Their role in the transportation system is vital, enabling quick and efficient movement, while also enhancing accessibility and convenience for a range of needs, from local residents to tourists exploring the city's dynamism.<br>
 Taxi regulations in NYC are regulated by the New York City (NYC) Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). 
# Problem Statement
Drivers in New York City lost an average of 102 hours to traffic jams in 2021. In 2022, there were a total of 110,000 taxis circulating in New York City.
Regarding traffic congestion, there are 700,000 cars, taxis, and trucks entering Lower Manhattan in daily. This is one of the busiest areas in the world with the worst congestion in the United States. The average car speed is 11 KPH (source: detik.com, nyc.streetsblog.org).

Various strategic way have been made to address this congestion,  one them is a ride-sharing system for taxis in NYC. This Ride Sharing allows users to reduce congestion, as several consumers with the same destination are loaded into one taxi, theoretically reducing the number of taxis circulating in New York City by as much as 50%. However, practically, this **Ride Sharing is not popular among New Yorkers. From the NYC TLC  data  in January 2023, there were no taxi transactions using the ride-sharing rate code.**

# Objective
The aim of this case study is to analyze the factors that cause the option of 'ride sharing' is less favored by consumers.

# Project Scope
Using the NYC TLC trip record from January 2023, the scope of this project is to analyze taxi usage based on aspects such as time and service area.
